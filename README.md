## Description
This is a `README.md` file generator to help quickly create README files for GitHub repositories. This application runs on the command line in node. I installed Inquire.js to create the command line user interface. When the app is run it asks the user a series of questions that relate to the various sections of the README file. Once the user input is taken in, the `fs` module that is part of node writes this information to the `README.md` file. Once this data is pushed to the GitHub repository a polished README file with information about my project is generated. 

## Installation
This application requires the following to be installed: a `package.json` file using  `npm init`, and `inquire.js` as a dependency using  `npm i inquire`.

## Usage
Below is a short GIF demonstrating how to use this application using the command line. I've also included a link to a complete tutorial.
